# **&#60;BR / &#62;ING BAD**

---

## **Description**

In this practice project, I created a simple app that fetches and retrieves data from the Breaking Bad API. You can view character information, see popular quotes from the series, and look up character deaths. This application uses Express.js to establish the server, Handlebars as the view engine, and Axios to run the core GET requests.
